## Hi there 👋

I'm Daniel, a Physics & Astrophysics student at UC Irvine with a passion for exploring the cosmos and building cool things with code! 🚀

### 🔭 I'm currently working on...

- Serving as **Chief Scientist** for a NASA L'SPACE Mission Concept Academy team, designing science architectures for lunar robotic missions exploring lava pits on the Moon 🌙
- Analyzing massive astrophysical datasets - most recently processing 50,000+ quasar observations to understand cosmic evolution

### 🌱 I'm currently learning...

- Advanced systems engineering and mission design through NASA's programs
- Combining physics principles with computational methods to solve real-world space exploration challenges
- The intersection of quantum mechanics, cosmology, and data science

### 💼 Recent Highlights

- 🏆 Won $1000 bounty at Columbia blockchain hackathon for a Web3 credit scoring system
- 🚀 Designed science traceability matrices and payload trade studies for lunar missions
- 📊 Built data pipelines analyzing quasar properties to support Hubble's Law and understand universe expansion

### 💬 Ask me about...

- Lunar exploration missions and space mission design
- Quasar physics and cosmological data analysis
- Building Web3 applications and blockchain technology
- Physics simulations, data visualization, or astrophysics in general!
